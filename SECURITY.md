# Security Policy

MaskWise is designed to detect, redact, mask, and anonymize sensitive data across text, images, and structured data for LLM training datasets. Because of the nature of this project, security and privacy are top priorities. This document outlines how we handle supported versions, security updates, and vulnerability reporting.

## Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the latest stable releases. Older versions may continue to function but will not receive patches.

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| v1.2.x    | ✅                 |
| v1.1.x    | ❌                 |
| v1.0.x    | ❌                 |
| < v1.0    | ❌                 |

Only the most recent **minor release branch** will receive security patches. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release to remain protected.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security reports seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in MaskWise, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities.
2. Report the issue privately via **hello@bluewavelabs.ca**.
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - A description of the vulnerability  
   - Steps to reproduce  
   - Potential impact  
   - Suggested fix (if any)  

### What to Expect

- You will receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours** of your report.
- We will provide updates at least every **7 days** while we investigate.
- Once a fix is developed, we will:
  - Prepare a security patch release  
  - Publicly disclose the vulnerability with credit to the reporter (unless anonymity is requested)  
  - Notify users via release notes and repository updates  

### Responsible Disclosure

We request that you **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we have confirmed a fix is available and users have had a reasonable amount of time to upgrade. This helps us protect all MaskWise users.
